# Function
* this directory shows the use of a function with a return type, whose value
was passed from the main function.
* functions with return values in Rust, doesn't neccesarily require a 'return' keyword
or terminates with a semicolon (;).
* To indicate that a function is a return function, it should have an arrow i.e '->' 
together with the value return type attached to the function definition.
