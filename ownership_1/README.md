# Ownership in Rust
* Ownership in Rust is about safety, memory utilization and prevention of undefined 
behaviors.
* It shows how variables live in the stack and also, how references, memory access and
ownership of data is moved from one owner to another, as the program is 
executing.
* Ownership in Rust is done automatically. It prevents manual memory management (e.g malloc and free), in order to prevent undefined behaviors.
* once ownership is changed in Rust, reference to the previous owner is automatically 
freed up
