# Publishing a Crate to Crates.io
The documentation comment in lib.rs is used to show how a crate can be create
and published so other developers can make use of the Crate.

* My_crate is a simple Crate that shows the usage of the add_one function, 
whose duty is to return the result of adding **1** to whatever value passed
to it.
* This Crate is published publicly into an html file using **cargo doc --open**
