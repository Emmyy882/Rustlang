# Running a Subset of Test by Name
Sometimes, running a full test suite can take a long time. If youâ€™re working on code in a particular area, you might want to run only the tests pertaining to that code. You can choose which tests to run by passing **cargo test** the name or names of the test(s) you want to run as an argument.
